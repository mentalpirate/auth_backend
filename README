# Auth Backend with Supabase + FastAPI

This is a demo project for an authentication backend using Supabase and FastAPI.

## Environment Setup

1. Create a new Python virtual environment: `python -m venv env`
2. Activate the virtual environment: `source env/bin/activate`
3. Install the project dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Set the environment variables:
   - `SUPABASE_URL`
   - `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
   - `API_BASE_URL`
   - `FRONTEND_BASE_URL`
   - `COOKIE_DOMAIN`
   - `COOKIE_SECURE`
   - `COOKIE_SAMESITE`
   - `ACCESS_TOKEN_COOKIE`
   - `REFRESH_TOKEN_COOKIE`

## Running the Application

1. Run the application using `uvicorn`: `uvicorn main:app --reload`
2. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/docs` to access the FastAPI documentation.

## Development

The project uses `FastAPI` as the web framework and `Supabase` as the database.
The code is organized into the following directories:

- `main.py`: The main application file.
- `models`: The data models used by the application.
- `routes`: The API routes defined by the application.
- `schemas`: The JSON schema definitions used by the application.

To develop the project, follow these steps:

1. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b <new-branch-name>`
2. Make changes to the code: `git add .` and `git commit -m "<commit-message>"`
3. Push the changes to GitHub: `git push origin <new-branch-name>`
4. Create a pull request to merge the changes into the `main` branch.

## Deployment

The project can be deployed to any platform that supports Python and HTTP servers.
The deployment process involves the following steps:

1. Create a production-ready `requirements.txt` file.
2. Install the project dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Set the environment variables.
4. Run the application using `uvicorn`: `uvicorn main:app`
5. Configure a reverse proxy server to route incoming requests to the application.
